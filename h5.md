# It's Alive!

## a) lab1

As usual, I want to see what is the problem.

```bash
$ wget https://terokarvinen.com/application-hacking/lab1.zip
$ unzip lab1.zip
$ cd lab1/
$ ./gdb_example1
Khoor/#zruog1
Segmentation fault
```

The program prints a text, then gets the segmentation fault&mdash;or prints *"Segmentation fault"* literally&mdash;and exits. I just want to make sure the program does not print the error string itself. Who knows!

```bash
$ ./gdb_example1 || echo $?
Khoor/#zruog1
Segmentation fault
139
```

Because this task is only about investigating the root cause of the problem and how to fix it, I'll go straight to the source code. The first and only thing, which catches my eyes, is one of the big mistakes of programming: *dereferencing a NULL pointer.* 

```c
int main()
{
  char * bad_message = NULL; // Okay...
  char * good_message = "Hello, world.";

  print_scrambled(good_message);
  print_scrambled(bad_message); // Wait! On purpose???
}
```

It is such the most common mistake that every developer makes or faces in their professional career. It leads to the error we met at the beginning: *segmentation fault*. As far as I know, this error has many other names: [memory access violation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/inside/c0000005), null pointer exception (Java), null reference exception (C#). There is even a story about it: [the billion-dollar mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer#History). The error, when it happens, will crash the program immediately. This behavior is done by modern operating systems&mdash;such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS&mdash;to prevent any further damage the error might cause.

**How to fix:** Actually I don't know what is the exact purpose of Lari's asking a question but with an answer in there. Probably it is simply **to remove the lines that cause the problem.** It is about doing only the good things, isn't it?

* Fix the source code

```c
int main()
{
  char * good_message = "Hello, world.";

  print_scrambled(good_message);
}
```

* Re-compile and run

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -g -o gdb_example1_fixed gdb_example1.c
$ ./gdb_example1_fixed || echo $?
Khoor/#zruog1
```
