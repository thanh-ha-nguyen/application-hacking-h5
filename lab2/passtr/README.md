	$ sudo apt-get install make gcc micro

Run

	$ ./passtr

To edit and compile the source code

	$ micro passtr.c
	$ make
	$ ./passtr

The binary is already compiled for regular PC's aka amd64. If you've got an arm64 (Raspberry Pi or Mac M1, M2, M3 or M4), try recompiling it ('make clean; make'). 

Do not remove passtr2o, you don't have source code for it!

Note!
Try to use debugger to receive a FLAG, you have all required skills to solve this.

Malicious hackers have initiated an attack, and you have the power to prevent it from succeeding. Your mission is to neutralize the threat by cracking the passtr2o Linux program and extracting the hidden FLAG it contains.

Once you've successfully obtained the FLAG:

Write a detailed report explaining the steps you took to crack the program and retrieve the FLAG.
